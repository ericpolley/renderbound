          One Month In: An Update on My Creative Journey
Hey everyone, Eric Polley here! It’s been a month since I launched my first blog, and I’m thrilled to share some exciting updates with you. The past few weeks have been a whirlwind of creativity, hard work, and exploration. From diving deep into the world of animation and game development to balancing a full-time job, it's been a challenging yet fulfilling journey. Let's dive into what I've been up to, what’s on the horizon, and how everything is coming together.
<br /><br />
The Mated Podcast: A Vision in Motion<br />
One of the most significant projects I've been working on is the Mated Podcast. For those who may not be familiar, the Mated Podcast is my brainchild—a unique blend of live-action interviews and animation. The idea is to create a show where I interview guests in live-action, but animate myself as a cartoon character interacting with them. The concept is something I’ve been passionate about for a long time, and it feels incredible to see it slowly coming to life.
<br /><br />
Setting the Stage<br />
Over the past month, I've been laying the groundwork for the podcast. This includes not only brainstorming and refining the format but also working on the technical aspects. I’m planning to record the interviews using Google calls and OBS, ensuring high-quality footage that can later be transformed into engaging, animated episodes.
<br /><br />
One of the most challenging but rewarding parts of this project has been developing the animation style. I want the animations to complement the interviews perfectly, creating a seamless blend of reality and imagination. The cartoon version of myself is almost complete, and I’ve been experimenting with different animation techniques to bring it to life.
<br /><br />
Expanding the Concept<br />
While the main idea is to have these interviews turned into full-length episodes, I’m also planning to create shorter, animated clips based on the interviews. These 30-second to 1-minute shorts will highlight the most memorable moments from each episode, making them perfect for social media sharing and giving people a taste of what the Mated Podcast is all about.
<br /><br />
But that’s not all! I’ve been toying with the idea of incorporating different segments into the podcast. These could range from animated skits to mini-documentaries, each bringing a unique flavor to the show. Although I’m not ready to reveal all the details just yet, rest assured that some exciting content is in the pipeline.
<br /><br />
2D Character/3D Background World-Building: A New Dimension of Creativity<br />
In addition to the Mated Podcast, I’ve been experimenting with combining 2D characters with 3D backgrounds. This fusion of two different animation styles is something that has always fascinated me. There’s something magical about seeing a flat, hand-drawn character interact with a richly detailed 3D environment, and I’m excited to explore this further.
<br /><br />
The Inspiration Behind the Project<br />
The idea came to me while reflecting on some of my favorite animated films and video games. Titles like Undertale, Earthbound, and OFF have always captivated me with their unique art styles and compelling narratives. They’ve inspired me to push the boundaries of what’s possible in animation, blending different techniques to create something truly original.
<br /><br />
I’ve been sketching out characters and designing 3D environments that feel alive and immersive. One of the most challenging aspects has been ensuring that the 2D characters don't feel out of place in the 3D world. This involves careful consideration of lighting, shadows, and perspective to create a harmonious blend.
<br /><br />
Building the World<br />
World-building is an intricate process that requires a deep understanding of the story and the characters that inhabit it. I’ve been working on creating a world that feels vibrant and full of life. Each element, from the buildings to the landscapes, has been carefully designed to reflect the mood and tone of the project.
<br /><br />
One of the worlds I’m building is a fantastical city with towering skyscrapers, bustling streets, and hidden alleys. The city is filled with unique characters, each with their own story to tell. As I continue to develop this world, I’m constantly refining the design, adding details that make it feel more authentic and lived-in.
<br /><br />
This project is still in its early stages, but the potential is enormous. I’m excited to see where this journey takes me and how the world I’m creating will evolve over time.
<br /><br />
RPG Game Development: A Nod to the Classics<br />
Another major project on my plate is developing an RPG game inspired by Undertale, OFF, and Earthbound. These games have had a profound impact on me, not just as a gamer, but as a creator. Their ability to blend quirky humor, deep storytelling, and innovative gameplay mechanics is something I aspire to achieve in my own game.
<br /><br />
Conceptualizing the Game<br />
The RPG I’m working on is still in its conceptual phase, but I’ve already laid out some of the core ideas. The game will feature a mix of light-hearted humor and emotional storytelling, much like the games that inspired it. The combat system will be turn-based, with unique mechanics that keep players engaged and on their toes.
<br /><br />
One of the key elements I’m focusing on is the narrative. I want the story to be rich and engaging, with memorable characters and unexpected twists. The protagonist will be a character who finds themselves in a strange, surreal world, filled with bizarre creatures and mysterious beings. As they navigate this world, they’ll uncover secrets, form alliances, and face challenges that test their resolve.
<br /><br />
Designing the Game World<br />
The game world is where I’m putting a lot of my creative energy. I want each area of the game to feel distinct and full of personality. From eerie forests to quirky towns, every location will have its own unique flavor. The art style will be a blend of pixel art and hand-drawn elements, giving the game a nostalgic yet fresh look.
<br />
I’ve been experimenting with different tools and engines to bring this world to life. RPG Maker has been a great starting point, allowing me to quickly prototype ideas and see how they play out in real-time. As the project progresses, I’m planning to refine the gameplay mechanics, add more depth to the story, and polish the visuals to create a cohesive experience.
<br /><br />
Balancing a Full-Time Job with Creative Pursuits<br />
While all these creative projects are incredibly fulfilling, they do come with their own set of challenges—especially when you’re balancing them with a full-time job. As some of you may know, I work full-time refurbishing electronics. It’s a demanding job that requires a lot of attention to detail and precision, but it’s also a job that I find rewarding in its own way.
<br /><br />
The Day-to-Day Grind<br />
Working full-time while pursuing creative projects is no easy feat. My days are often packed, with little time to spare. I usually start my day early, spending the first few hours working on my creative projects before heading off to work. After a long day of refurbishing electronics, I come home and dive back into my projects, often working late into the night.
<br />
It’s a demanding schedule, but one that I’ve come to embrace. I’ve learned to manage my time effectively, prioritizing tasks and setting realistic goals. While it’s not always easy to find the energy to work on creative projects after a long day, the passion I have for these projects keeps me going.
<br /><br />
Finding Inspiration in Everyday Life<br />
One of the things I’ve discovered is that inspiration can come from the most unexpected places. Whether it’s a conversation with a colleague, a problem I encounter at work, or something I see on the way home, I’m always on the lookout for ideas that can spark creativity. These everyday experiences often find their way into my projects, adding depth and authenticity to the stories I’m telling.
<br />
Future Plans and Untold Ideas<br />
While I’ve shared quite a bit about what I’m currently working on, there are a few more ideas brewing behind the scenes that I’m not quite ready to announce just yet. These ideas are still in the early stages, and I’m taking my time to flesh them out and see where they lead. However, I can say that they involve exploring new mediums and experimenting with different storytelling techniques.
<br />
Expanding My Creative Horizons<br />
As someone who loves to explore new creative avenues, I’m always looking for ways to challenge myself and push my boundaries. Whether it’s diving into a new animation technique, experimenting with different art styles, or exploring new narrative structures, I’m constantly seeking out opportunities to grow as an artist.
<br />
The projects I’m currently working on are just the beginning. I have big plans for the future, and I’m excited to see how these ideas evolve over time. While I can’t reveal all the details just yet, I’m confident that they’ll add a new dimension to my work and open up new possibilities for creative expression.
<br /><br />
A Journey of Continuous Learning<br />
One of the things I’ve come to appreciate over the past month is the importance of continuous learning. Whether it’s mastering a new software tool, learning a new animation technique, or studying the work of other artists, I’m always striving to improve my skills and expand my knowledge.
<br />
This journey of learning is something that I find incredibly rewarding. Each new skill I acquire, each new technique I master, adds to my creative toolkit and opens up new possibilities for my work. It’s a journey that I’m committed to, and one that I believe is essential for any artist who wants to keep growing and evolving.
<br /><br />
Final Thoughts<br />
As I reflect on the past month, I’m filled with a sense of accomplishment and excitement. While the journey has been challenging, it’s also been incredibly rewarding. I’m proud of the progress I’ve made, and I’m excited to continue working on these projects in the months
